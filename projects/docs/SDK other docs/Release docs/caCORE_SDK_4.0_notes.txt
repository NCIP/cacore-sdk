    The caCORE Software Development Kit (SDK) is a set of tools
    that can be used by an intermediate Java developer to create
    a 'caCORE-like' system. Such systems are constructed using
    certain design principles:

    --  UML Modeling

    --  n-tier architecture with open APIs

    --  controlled vocabularies

    --  registered metadata

    A system built along these lines is said to be 'semantically
    integrated', that is, there exists runtime metadata that
    describes every class and class attribute in the API.

    +---------------------------------------+
    | Updates / New Features                |
    +---------------------------------------+

    caCORE SDK 4.0 is a major release with many new features available. 
    Some of the newly developed features are to improve the infrastructure 
    and others are to support new requirements. A list highlighting the
    major functionality and performance enhancements and improvements introduced 
    in the caCORE SDK 4.0 release is provided below.

    Code Generation:  
    The architecture and the core of the code generation module of the caCORE 
    SDK 4.0 has been completely rewritten. The Entire code generation 
    framework now runs from a single configuration file based on the Spring Framework 
    as opposed to individual configuration files used by previous releases. Some of 
    the more visible improvements in the code generation module are highlighted below.

    -- Support for Enterprise Architect and ArgoUML: Previous releases of the
       caCORE SDK used to support only Enterprise Architect as a tool for UML 
       modeling. With SDK 4.0, users can choose between ArgoUML and Enterprise 
       Architect. The added support for ArgoUML provides users an open source 
       alternative to commercial software like Enterprise Architect.  

    -- Code Generation performance improvement:  The caCORE SDK 4.0 has 
       significantly improved the performance of the code generation module. 
       Average users should notice the system generation process to be completed 
       in approximately 15% of time of what it used to take with the previous 
       releases of SDK. 
     	
    -- Support for Validators:  The caCORE SDK code generator now supports 
       validators, which serve the purpose of validating the object model and 
       object-relational mapping information before the code generator starts. 
       These validators provide descriptive messages to users which allow users 
       to quickly identify the root cause of the code generation failure.   
	 	
    -- Reduced and Improved Generated Artifacts:  The artifacts generated by 
       caCORE SDK are completely redesigned to suit the needs of the newly 
       redesigned runtime system. Artifacts generated by previous releases of 
       the SDK were not reusable outside of SDK due to certain dependencies on 
       the SDK.  Artifacts generated by the SDK 4.0, however, can be reused elsewhere. 
       For example, Java Beans generated by the SDK had getter methods that would 
       connect to the server; they were not simple POJOs.  In SDK 4.0, the generated
       beans are indeed simple POJO beans. 

    -- Support for Additional UML Features:  The SDK now supports many new UML 
       features in the object model and in the object-relational mapping process.

       Object Model:

       -- ID attribute:  Users of the caCORE SDK no longer have to name the attribute 
          that maps to the primary key column of the corresponding table for the 
          class as "ID". Users can now specify the attribute mapping to primary key 
          column using a tag value on the class in the domain model.

       -- Support for primitives:  SDK 4.0 allows users to use Java Primitive types to
            specify an attribute's data type.

       -- Support for primitive collections:  Users of the SDK can now use primitive 
	    collections or data types when specifying the attribute type.

       Object Relational Mapping:

       -- Inheritance:  caCORE SDK 4.0 now supports an alternate way of mapping 
          inheritance hierarchy in the database. SDK users can choose between 
          existing "Table per class" mechanism to map inheritance in the database,
          or they can use "Table per inheritance hierarchy" for the mapping.

       -- Join tables: Previous releases of the SDK used to only support join tables 
          for the many-to-many type of associations. With SDK 4.0, users can choose 
          to use join tables for any type of association.

    Generated System: In addition to the new code generator module, caCORE SDK 4.0 has 
    introduced significant changes in the runtime system. Since many of the changes are
    in the infrastructure, mostly users utilizing advance options will notice or be 
    affected by the restructuring of the SDK’s runtime system.

    -- Client-Server infrastructure improvements: 

       -- The client-server infrastructure of SDK used to rely on the Java beans 
          developed specifically for SDK. These specialized java beans had the capability
          to connect to the server when required to fetch the associated objects. With 
          SDK 4.0, regular POJOs are used in conjunction with concepts from Aspect 
          Oriented Programming (AOP) to facilitate similar mechanism. With this design 
          approach, domain object beans generated by SDK are true POJOs and can be used 
          outside of SDK more easily. 

       -- In addition to the restructuring of the Java beans with AOP, SDK 4.0 now also 
          can connect to various SDK generated systems from within the same client JVM. 
          In previous versions, users of the SDK could connect to only one remote 
          service at a time; with this feature, developers will now be able to retrieve 
          data from multiple data services.

    -- Simplified Application Service:  Many of the existing methods of the Application 
       Service interface have been deprecated. Newly added methods have a syntax similar 
       to the existing methods, but they now require less information. The simplified 
       Application Service interface will be easier to work with.

    -- Web Services.  

       -- SDK 4.0 generated web services work with the simple POJO beans. The 
          Web Service from previous version of SDK required specialized POJO beans in the .ws
          package, whereas SDK 4.0 generated web services utilizes the same Java beans that 
          are used by the other tiers of the application.
 
       -- SDK 4.0 web services also have additional methods to allow users to fetch the 
          associations of the domain object. Users can now specify which specific 
          association they would like to fetch from the server.

       -- Starting with version 4.0, users of the SDK will not have to deploy the Web 
          Service independently. The SDK 4.0 generated web services are embedded in the 
          .war file, and will be deployed automatically when the application server starts.

    -- Graphical User Interface

       -- The caCORE SDK 4.0 generated system has a newly developed graphical user 
          interface. This new interface allows users a richer experience. 

       -- Security of the new user interface has been enhanced. Users now have access to 
          built in security capabilities such that when the security is enabled in the 
          system, users will get experience of completely secured system and not just one 
          of the secured interface.

       -- The caCORE SDK 4.0 generated GUI now has embedded Javadocs for the domain 
          objects for which the system was originally generated. Users of the web 
          interface can browse the Javadocs by visiting a link on the generated system’s 
          home page.

       -- Previous releases of the SDK did not allow fetching of an associated object that
          had more than one association with another object.  The newly generated web 
          interface allows user to retrieve associations regardless of the number of 
          associations between two objects.
 
    -- Security

       -- The caCORE SDK 4.0 has a completely new security implementation that is based on
          the ACEGI security framework. The previous implementation of security in the 
          caCORE SDK was weaved into the application logic. For caCORE SDK 4.0, security 
          implementation is kept outside of the application and is managed through Aspect 
          Oriented Programming principles. SDK users can now more easily change the 
          implementation of security without going into the details of SDK’s core code 
          base. 

       -- Instance level security:  The caCORE SDK 4.0 supports instance level security 
          utilizing CSM, which provides flexibility to provide more granular access to the
          data. For example, users can be given access to only a subset of records from a 
          particular table vs. all the records of a particular table. 

       -- Attribute level security:  In addition to the instance level security, the caCORE
          SDK 4.0 also provides a very granular attribute level security to the users.  For
          example, only certain users are allowed to see Social Security Numbers of a 
          Person object. 

       -- Concurrent user access in secured API:  Users of the SDK generated java client in 
          the previous releases were constrained to use the same user account throughout 
          the lifecycle of the ApplicationService. In SDK 4.0, users can create many 
          different instances of the ApplicationService and login with different user 
          accounts at the same time from different threads of the client application. 



================================================================
	3.0 Bug Fixes Since Last Release
================================================================

    -- When two objects have multiple associations between
       them, the generated system of previous SDK versions would 
       only return one of the associated object via the HTTP and 
       Web Service interfaces. SDK 4.0 corrects this issue by 
       providing API's that allow the user to specify the particular
       association.



================================================================
	4.0 Known Issues
================================================================

    -- The SDK will not generate both ends of bi-directional 
	 self associations within the Java Beans.

    -- The caCORE Castor-based Marshaller does not currently handle 
	 recursive bi-directional associations.	

    -- The SDK purposely ignores the lower-bound multiplicity
	 value from the UML model when generating the Schemas.  A
	 deployment option/property will be provided in a future 
	 release that will force the SDK to honor the value placed
	 within the model.

    -- When building a system, an error will be generated if
	 Java keywords are used as class and/or attribute names in
	 the UML logical model.  Similarly, SQL keywords in the
	 data model will generate errors.
   
    -- If you use multiple datasources from different databases
	 servers, the toolkit will not be able to generate
	 multiple orm*.cfg.xml files automatically. You will need
	 to generate a single ORM, then manually split that file
	 into however many ORM's you are using.

    -- The HTTP interface has reserved characters like % and #.
	 If the reserved characters are part of the query, the
	 HTTP parser will not work correctly.
	
	 Example:  "test%122".  

	 A workaround is to use the wild card character '*':

	 Example:  "test*122"
